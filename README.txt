- That SQL temporarily disables RLS on app tables for testing and keeps Storage insert-only.
- JS syntax check: OK

- No new page, no overlay, no sidebar/header/layout design changes.
- KYC rows still load from Supabase DB and approve/reject updates DB.

- Existing admin KYC design/layout unchanged.
- Approve button becomes disabled text when row is already approved.
- JS syntax check: OK

  - PENDING: form hidden, shows under-review card.
  - REJECTED: form remains available for resubmission.

  3. user_payout_methods

CLEAN STEP 1 - HTML BASE CLEANUP
==============================

What changed:

Next step:
Build clean auth/session, then dashboard/wallet/admin logic.
